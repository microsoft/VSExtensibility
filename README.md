# Welcome to VisualStudio.Extensibility

VisualStudio.Extensibility is a new framework for developing Visual Studio extensions. The new framework focuses primarily on extensions that run out-of-process from the IDE for improved performance and reliability, and it features a modern, asynchronous API that has been streamlined and carefully engineered to maximize developer productivity. VisualStudio.Extensibility is in active development and is available as a preview.

With the current preview, you can develop a wide range of extensions to Visual Studio, including creating commands, working with code or text in the editor, displaying prompts or dialogs to the user, creating debugger visualizers, and more!

VisualStudio.Extensibility aims to address many of the problems developers experience when using and writing extensions in Visual Studio:

* Visual Studio remains responsive and won't crash if an extension crashes or hangs
* Simplified architecture, consistent APIs, and clear documentation
* Extensions can be installed without restarting Visual Studio

Eventually, the VisualStudio.Extensibility SDK will ultimately allow you to write any extension you could write using the VSSDK. However, until that time, you might encounter situations where the functionality you need in your extension is not yet available in VisualStudio.Extensibility. In that case, you can develop an in-process extension by leveraging the new VisualStudio.Extensibility APIs while relying on VSSDK to cover any feature gap. To learn more, see [In-proc extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/extensibility/visualstudio.extensibility/get-started/in-proc-extensions).

**Important** Documentation for the VisualStudio.Extensibility SDK has moved to a new location: [VisualStudio.Extensibility documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/extensibility/visualstudio.extensibility).

Documentation is currently available for the following:

* VisualStudio.Extensibility SDK (see the following sections)
* [Extensions to Language Server Protocol (LSP)](docs/lsp/lsp-extensions-specifications.md)

## Install VisualStudio.Extensibility

The current VisualStudio.Extensibility preview works with Visual Studio 2022 version 17.9 Preview 1 or higher with the `Visual Studio extension development` workload to be installed. VisualStudio.Extensibility extensions can be installed on Visual Studio 2022 version 17.9 Preview 1 and above.

## Get Started

The following articles will help you get oriented and started.

* [Create your first extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/extensibility/visualstudio.extensibility/get-started/create-your-first-extension) shows how to create the equivalent of "Hello, world" as an extension.
* Next, follow a tutorial and create a more interesting extension that adds a GUID to the editor window. See [Create a simple extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/extensibility/visualstudio.extensibility/get-started/tutorial-create-simple-extension).

To understand how to work with VisualStudio.Extensibility, we recommend a thorough understanding of [asynchronous programming with async and await](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/) and [dependency injection](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection). In addition, UI in VisualStudio.Extensibility is based on Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), so you might want to review the [WPF documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/desktop/wpf/).

## Concepts

If you're familiar with the Visual Studio SDK, see [Introduction to VisualStudio.Extensibility for VSSDK users](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/extensibility/visualstudio.extensibility/get-started/oop-extensibility-model-overview).

Build your mental model of how Visual Studio extensions work. See [Parts of a new Visual Studio extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/extensibility/visualstudio.extensibility/inside-the-sdk/extension-anatomy).

Learn what's in the SDK at [Functional areas of the SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/extensibility/visualstudio.extensibility/inside-the-sdk/inside-the-sdk).

When and where should your extension appear in the IDE? Visual Studio extensions surface in the IDE when certain conditions are met. To control how and when your extension appears in the IDE, see [Rule-based activation constraints](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/extensibility/visualstudio.extensibility/inside-the-sdk/activation-constraints).

Visual Studio extensions make their features available to Visual Studio through [Contributions](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/extensibility/visualstudio.extensibility/inside-the-sdk/contributions-and-configurations)

Learn about the [Remote UI](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/extensibility/visualstudio.extensibility/inside-the-sdk/remote-ui) model used in the VisualStudio.Extensibility.

## Overviews

Read an overview of the areas of the SDK that you might need for your extension development projects:

* To learn how to create commands and expose them to users in the IDE, see [Commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/extensibility/visualstudio.extensibility/command/command).
* To learn how to work with contents of files and documents, see [Editor](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/extensibility/visualstudio.extensibility/editor/editor?view=vs-2022).
* To learn how to work with the in-memory representation of those documents themselves, see [Documents](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/extensibility/visualstudio.extensibility/document/documents)
* To learn how to use the output window in an extension, see [Output window](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/extensibility/visualstudio.extensibility/output-window/output-window).
* To learn how to work with tool windows, dockable windows within the Visual Studio IDE, see [Tool windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/extensibility/visualstudio.extensibility/tool-window/tool-window).
* To learn how to use prompts with customizable buttons to interact with the user, see [User prompts](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/extensibility/visualstudio.extensibility/user-prompt/user-prompts).
