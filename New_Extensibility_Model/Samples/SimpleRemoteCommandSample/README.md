## Simple Remote Command Sample

This extension is meant to act as the simplest possible sample for getting started with creating an extension that has a command. The command in the sample is parented to a group in under the "Tools" top level menu in Visual Studio. The command in the sample will have the "Extension" image moniker displayed beside the command's Display Name in the menu.
