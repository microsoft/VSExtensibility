# Creating your first in-process VisualStudio.Extensibility extension

## Introduction
While the VisualStudio.Extensibility model was created primarily to host extensions outside of the devenv.exe process, starting with Visual Studio 17.3 it is possible to build a VisualStudio.Extensibility extension that are hosted within devenv.exe and can leverage traditional extensibility APIs provided by the [Microsoft.VisualStudio.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Sdk) packages.

The support of *in-proc* extensions is meant to allow early adopters to leverage the new VisualStudio.Extensibility APIs while relying on [Microsoft.VisualStudio.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Sdk) to cover any feature gap.

At this time, VSIX extensions containing VisualStudio.Extensibility references cannot be uploaded to the Visual Studio Marketplace due to VisualStudio.Extensibility being in preview status.

This document is a quick walkthrough on how to create your first *in-proc* extension using the VisualStudio.Extensibility model.

## Prerequisites

* Visual Studio 2022 17.4 Preview 1 or higher with the ".NET desktop development" and "Visual Studio extension development" workloads.

* Install [VisualStudio.Extensibility Project System](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsext.gladstone): This extension contains project templates for VisualStudio.Extensibility extensions.

## Create the extension project

* Use the *VisualStudio.Extensibility In-Process Extension Project* template to create a new solution.

## Debug your extension

* Set the *Container* project as *Startup Project*, press `F5` to start debugging.

* This will build your extension and deploy it to the experimental instance of Visual Studio version you are using. The debugger should attach once your extension is loaded.

* You can find the command in `Tools` menu as shown.

## Consuming Visual Studio SDK services from a VisualStudio.Extensibility extension

An *in-proc* extension project references the [Microsoft.VisualStudio.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Sdk) package which allows access to all Visual Studio SDK's services.

Traditionally, such services are consumed through either [MEF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/managed-extensibility-framework-in-the-editor) or the [AsyncServiceProvider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.shell.asyncserviceprovider). A VisualStudio.Extensibility extender is instead encouraged to leverage [.NET depedency injection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection).

The `MefInjection<TService>` and `AsyncServiceProviderInjection<TService, TInterface>` classes (both from the `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Extensibility` namespace) allow to consume the Visual Studio SDK's services by simply adding them to the constructor of a class that is instantiated through dependency injection (like a command, tool window or extension part).

The example below shows how the `DTE2` and `IBufferTagAggregatorFactoryService` services can be added to a command.

```CSharp
    [CommandIcon(KnownMonikers.Extension, IconSettings.IconAndText)]
    [Command("MyFirstInProcExtension.Command1", "Sample Remote Command", placement: KnownCommandPlacement.ToolsMenu)]
    public class Command1 : Command
    {
        private TraceSource traceSource;
		private AsyncServiceProviderInjection<DTE, DTE2> dte;
		private MefInjection<IBufferTagAggregatorFactoryService> bufferTagAggregatorFactoryService;

        public Command1(
			VisualStudioExtensibility extensibility,
			TraceSource traceSource,
			AsyncServiceProviderInjection<DTE, DTE2> dte,
			MefInjection<IBufferTagAggregatorFactoryService> bufferTagAggregatorFactoryService,
			string id)
			: base(extensibility, id)
    {
		this.dte = dte;
		this.bufferTagAggregatorFactoryService = bufferTagAggregatorFactoryService;
    }
```

## Anatomy of an in-proc VisualStudio.Extensibility extension

While using the *VisualStudio.Extensibility In-Process Extension Project* template takes care of setting up the entire solution, it is useful to know what are the basic components of an *in-proc* VisualStudio.Extensibility extension and how it differs from the *out-of-proc* variant described in the ["create your first extension" guide](create-your-first-extension.md).

### Container project

An *in-proc* VisualStudio.Extensibility solution is composed of two projects:
1. a class library that references both the VisualStudio.Extensibility and Visual Studio SDK packages and contains all the code of the extension,
1. a container VSIX project that provides the ability to deploy the debug the extension.

This separation is a temporary solution while the VisualStudio.Extensibility is in preview and the final packaging and deployment design is being finalized.

The extender shouldn't add code, content or resources to the container project. The only goal of the container project is to include the assets provided by the other project.

### TargetFramework

Both the extension project and the container project must target the .NET version used by the target Visual Studio version. For Visual Studio 2022, they must target .NET Framework 4.7.2.

### HostingOptionsAttribute

The `Extension` class must be marked with the `[HostingOptions(true)]` attribute that identifies the extension as being *in-proc*.

```CSharp
    [HostingOptions(requiresInProcessHosting: true)]
    public class InProcExtension : Extension
    {
```
