# Rule based activation constraints

One of the common concepts in Visual Studio Extensibility SDK is use of context based activation rules in code attributes. An example of these would [CommandVisibleWhen](../api/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Extensibility.md#T-Microsoft-VisualStudio-Extensibility-Commands-CommandVisibleWhenAttribute) attribute declaring when a command is made visible.

Our goal is to provide a common way to create such contexts, the current method is based on existing [Rule-based UI contexts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/how-to-use-rule-based-ui-context-for-visual-studio-extensions) with a different set of context terms.

## Constraint attribute arguments

Each constraint attribute will contain at least 3 required arguments that defines the expression:

* Expression string: A boolean expression using `and`, `or`, `not` operations and term names that are defined in later arguments. Each term must be a single word (without spaces) and expression can utilize parentheses for grouping and `&`, `|`, `!` operators for `and`, `or`, `not` operations.

* Term names: An array that contains the name of the terms used in the expression above.

* Term definitions: An array that defines the each term in the order terms are defined in the names array above.

## Example definition

In the example below, the code attributes defines when a command is in enabled state.

* The expression indicates that command is enabled when both `SolutionLoaded` and `IsValidFile` terms are true.

* `SolutionLoaded` term is defined as `SolutionState:Exists` which indicates, the term evaluates to `true` when a solution exists in the IDE.

* `IsValidFile` term is true when selected file in Solution Explorer is a jpeg or text file as defined by the file extension.

```csharp
[CommandEnabledWhen(
    "SolutionLoaded & IsValidFile",
    new string[] { 
        "SolutionLoaded", 
        "IsValidFile" },
    new string[] { 
        "SolutionState:Exists", 
        @"ClientContext:Shell.ActiveSelectionFileName=\.(jpg|jpeg|txt)$" })]
```

## Available terms

Following is the list of terms currently supported by expression engine.

| Term | Description
| -- | -- |
| SolutionHasProjectBuildProperty:\<property>=\<regex> | The term is true when solution has a loaded project with the specified build property and property value matches to regex filter provided. |
| SolutionHasProjectCapability:\<expression> | True whenever solution has a project with  capabilities matching the provided subexpression. An expression can be something like VB | CSharp. |
| SolutionHasProjectFlavor:\<guid> | True whenever a solution has project that is flavored (aggregated) and has a flavor matching the given project type GUID. |
| SolutionState:\<state> | True when solution state matches to provided value, see [solution states](#solution-states) for list of values. |
| ProjectAddedItem:\<pattern> | The term is true when a file matching the "pattern" is added to a project in the solution that is opened. |
| ClientContext:\<key>=\<pattern> | True when the provided client context key matches to regular expression. See [client contexts](#client-contexts) for more details. |

## Solution states

| State | Description |
| -- | -- |
| NoSolution | No solution loaded. |
| Exists | A solution is opened but may be in loaded or loading state. |
| FullyLoaded | A solution is opened and fully loaded. |
| Empty | Solution contains no projects but may contain solution items. |
| SingleProject | Solution contains a single project. |
| MultipleProject | Solution contains multiple projects. |
| Building | Solution is building. |

## Client contexts
Activation rules can also utilize the [client context](extension-anatomy.md#client-context) contents as parts of its expression. 

Currently, the client context is limited to a small set of values in IDE state:

| Context key | Definition |
| -- | -- |
| Shell.ActiveSelectionUri | Full URI for the selected item in solution explorer. |
| Shell.ActiveSelectionPath | Full path for the selected item in solution explorer. |
| Shell.ActiveSelectionFileName | File name of the selected item in solution explorer. |
| Shell.ActiveEditorContentType | Content type of the active editor view. |
| Shell.ActiveEditorFileName | File name for the document that belongs to active editor view. |
